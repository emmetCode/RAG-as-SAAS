# 📄 Rag-pdf

Rag-PDF is a scalable, document-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for querying and processing PDF documents. Built with a modern tech stack including Node.js, MongoDB, QdrantDB, Redis, express, Cohere LLM for embedding and a microservices architecture. Rag-PDF supports background workers for efficient task management and seamless scalability in production environments.

Key Features

a) PDF ingestion and processing with intelligent chunking and embedding

b) Vector-based retrieval using Qdrant, optimized for semantic search 

c) Retrieval-Augmented Generation using LLMs to answer questions based on document content

d) Microservices-based architecture for modularity and scalability

e) MongoDB storage for managing document metadata 

f) Background workers for handling long-running tasks asynchronously

g) Designed for production-scale deployments
